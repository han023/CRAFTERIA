The mobile app we are designing to encourage the distribution of handcrafts by independent
artisans is a terrific concept for supporting economic growth in financial collapse economies like
Sri Lanka. The app provides clients the ability to buy these items directly from the artisans while
offering a platform for artisans to promote their unique and quality handcrafts to a wider
audience.

Self-employed artisans and customers comprise the app's two major actors. The app allows
artisans to add their advertisements where they may advertise their handmade items with
images and descriptions. They can manage their listings effectively since they may change or
delete their advertisements whenever they want to. Consumers, on the other hand, may read
the app's amazing collection of handcrafted items, check prices, and buy them straight from the
artists. Customers may easily contact with the artists using the app to make specific requests,
which enables them to produce one-of-a-kind works of art.

This application offers an outstanding platform for independent artisans to interact with
customers anywhere in the world without any boundaries or limits. The app contains features
like payment gateway integration, a review and rating system, and a message system for simple
communication, making it simple to use for both artisans and customers.

Supporting the handicraft industry may normally have a number of beneficial social and
economic effects, especially in challenging times. Governments may contribute in economic
growth and financial contributions through stimulating entrepreneurship, supporting local
artisans, promoting tourism, increasing international commerce, and preserving cultural
heritage.

In conclusion, the handcraft selling mobile application is a great initiative to help artisans,
especially in economically difficult countries like Sri Lanka, showcase their artistry to a wider
audience while giving customers the chance to buy legitimate and one-of-a-kind handcrafted
products online from the artisans.
