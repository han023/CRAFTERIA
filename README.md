The mobile app we are designing to encourage the distribution of handcrafts by independent
artisans is a terrific concept for supporting economic growth in financial collapse economies like
Sri Lanka. The app provides clients the ability to buy these items directly from the artisans while
offering a platform for artisans to promote their unique and quality handcrafts to a wider
audience.

Self-employed artisans and customers comprise the app's two major actors. The app allows
artisans to add their advertisements where they may advertise their handmade items with
images and descriptions. They can manage their listings effectively since they may change or
delete their advertisements whenever they want to. Consumers, on the other hand, may read
the app's amazing collection of handcrafted items, check prices, and buy them straight from the
artists. Customers may easily contact with the artists using the app to make specific requests,
which enables them to produce one-of-a-kind works of art.

This application offers an outstanding platform for independent artisans to interact with
customers anywhere in the world without any boundaries or limits. The app contains features
like payment gateway integration, a review and rating system, and a message system for simple
communication, making it simple to use for both artisans and customers.

Supporting the handicraft industry may normally have a number of beneficial social and
economic effects, especially in challenging times. Governments may contribute in economic
growth and financial contributions through stimulating entrepreneurship, supporting local
artisans, promoting tourism, increasing international commerce, and preserving cultural
heritage.

In conclusion, the handcraft selling mobile application is a great initiative to help artisans,
especially in economically difficult countries like Sri Lanka, showcase their artistry to a wider
audience while giving customers the chance to buy legitimate and one-of-a-kind handcrafted
products online from the artisans.


**1. Introduction of Project**
  During a financial crisis, efficient grocery management may be extremely valuable in ensuring
  that people have access to the necessities they require while also eliminating waste and lowering
  expenses. Here are a few ways that managing your grocery store amid a financial crisis might be
  helpful.
  
    1) Inventory management-: Grocery businesses can minimize waste and costs while making
    sure they have enough of the most important items on hand to meet customer demand by
    carefully controlling inventory levels.
    
    2) Efficient supply chain management-:By optimizing their supply chain processes, grocery
    stores can ensure that they have a steady supply of essential items, even if there are
    disruptions to the supply chain during an economic crisis.
    
    3) Effective demand forecasting-: By accurately forecasting demand for different items,
    grocery stores can ensure that they have enough of the right products on hand, while also
    avoiding overstocking on items that may not sell as well during an economic crisis.
    
    4) Pricing techniques-: By employing dynamic pricing techniques, grocery stores can vary
    their prices in reaction to variations in demand, guaranteeing that they can maintain a
    profit while simultaneously providing customers with competitive pricing.
    
    5) Employee safety and training-: During a financial crisis, grocery stores must make sure
    that all of their staff members are adequately taught in safety procedures and that they
    have the tools and materials they need to protect both themselves and their customers.
    
    6) Supporting the local community-: During an economic crisis, grocery stores can play an
    important role in supporting the local community by sourcing products from local
    farmers and suppliers, and by donating excess food to food banks and other organizations
    that serve those in need.
    
    7) Free delivery -: The transport of goods in the area where this shop is located is free, and
    for other areas, an amount will be added to the bill. This is a successful solution to the
    current fuel problem
  Overall, effective grocery management can help grocery stores to efficiently and effectively meet
  the needs of their customers during an economic crisis, while also reducing costs and minimizing
  waste
